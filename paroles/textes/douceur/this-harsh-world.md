Come here, come here with your blue landscapes\
Come here, come here come here and we'll escape

This harsh world this harsh world\
This harsh world this harsh world

And in my arms you'll find\
what you've been looking for\
And in my arms you'll find\
love

In this harsh world this harsh world\
This harsh world this harsh world

And I'll give you all the tender you might need\
And I'll give myself to you, away from all\
the greed

Of this harsh world this harsh world\
This harsh world this harsh world

And I'll spend the night staring at the\
stars in your eyes\
And we'll spend the night\
Going further and further and further and further

From this harsh word this harsh world\
This harsh world this harsh world\
And in the great unknown\
We'll make our own
